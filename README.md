## Skills Required to finish the project

This project requires front-end programming skills as mentioned below:
1. Defining variables with const and let
2. Accessing the DOM using methods of the document object
3. Declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as event listeners
4. Writing nested loops and using loop variables

## How Does This Help My Career?
Interacting with the DOM — the structure of a web page — is one of the most fundamental skills for a front-end web developer. Mastering event listeners is essential to creating user interfaces — and to quite a few other things.
